<h1>The Top Best Movies According to Babloo</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of All time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>GODFATHER</h3>
<p>The Godfather is so good because it is a masterpiece of a film that is held together firmly through a strong cast, world-changing cinematography, and the music that intensifies the strong theme presented in the film.</p>

<h3>GAME OF THRONES</h3>

<p>One of the main reasons why we love Game of Thrones has to be that the show really does have a bit of everything. If you like romance, there’s plenty of that (weird & twisted in some cases, but still). If you like action, there’s a LOT of that. Politics, tick. Epic staging, tick. Mythology, tick. Costume drama elements, tick. Crime, tick. Dragons, tick!</p>
<h3>BREAKING BAD</h3>

<p>One of the main reasons for the proven timeless quality of Breaking Bad is simply how well-written the show is. From its wider themes, characters, and the stories intertwining the two, Breaking Bad remains the gold standard on how to write TV.</p>
